## Project Description:
In this assignemnt, I conveyed five important topics from lesson 3 on a webpage that contains a brief description of the topic along with a picture relating to the topic being discussed.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control is the means by which people edit and store files while maintaining a constant record of all the edits being done to the file for future reference.
2. Remote and local repositories are storehouses for files. The main difference between the two is that with a remote repository, the file is being stored on a server that is separate from the computer that the work is being done on. Local repositories store information locally to the computer being used to edit that information.  
3. GIT commands include add, commit, and push. As implied by the name, adding just contributes one or more files to an index. Commit basically updates the file with any edits that were made. Finally, pushing the file sends it to the appropriate repository.
