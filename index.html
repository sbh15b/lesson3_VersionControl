            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is the means by which large (or even small) collections of information are managed when multiple people are editing and saving changes. This information includes, but is not limited to, web development files, computer programs, or basic computer files and documents. A simple analogy would be volumes of different books, they all contain roughly the same information but newer versions are more reliable due to constant updates and changes being made. This topic is of interest to me because editing your own work or the work of other is important to coding and knowing that there are safe places for large files to be saved can be considered a relief. We will be doing exactly this in the class; therefore, it pertains to this course.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two different types of repositories discussed in this lesson. A repository is where files are stored between edits. What makes this specific kind of repository remote is that it is stored away from where the files are being changed and edited. For example, the edits are made on my beat up, 13 inch MacBook Pro in Tampa. However, these edits may not only be stored on my computer, but on a server some miles away from me. This is important in that it allows for updates to be made without the reliance on my local device to store the information, which is considered somewhat unsafe. This sparks my interest because there is little to no chances that my files will be lost, which means the files I edit for this class are safe at a remote location on a server.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Similar to the remote repository, the local repository stores files in between edits. These edited files, however, are not stored on a server several miles away, but right on the computer that is being used to edit these files. Saving to a local repository has benefits, such as no need for internet access. If you are at a location where internet is limited, you can still edit files but you will need to safe them locally, then push them to the remote repository when you have internet access for more safe keeping. I will likely use a combination of the two forms of repositories in my future, so when it comes to knowing and understanding these concepts, it is very important to me. In this class we will use mainly remote repositories to save files, either by using cloud9 or GitHub.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Often referred to as the most commonly used form of version control, GIT has become the new standard for version control. This allows for coders and programmers to edit information and send it to a remote repository. Again, if the user does not have access to internet they will need to store the updated file to a local repository and send it to the remote repository when internet access is obtained. Using the GIT commands, users can edit, commit, and push the files to the server almost whenever, wherever they are. Since we will use GitHub for this class, learning how to effectively use this resource is important to this class. Personally, I think this is very interesting in that it leaves very little room for error, which cannot be said about other forms of file saving.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three GIT commands are add, commit, and push. These are the 3 easy steps to editing and saving files to remote servers for safekeeping. The first step, add, send the file to the GIT index which basically summarizes the changes that are being made to the document. Committing is the process by which the changes to the files are recoded. This clearly shows the changes being made to the file. Then we can push the file. Pushing the file sends the commits to the file to the remote repository. This process pertains to everything we will be doing in this class. Assuming future assignments are like this one, we will be using the add, commit, and push process very frequently throughout the course of this class.</p>
